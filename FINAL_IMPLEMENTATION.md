# ✅ Final Implementation - Clean Multi-Agent Healthcare System

## Problem Solved ✅

**BEFORE**: The system was showing raw results from each source like this:
```
LOCAL DATABASE RESULTS: 'strep throat' was not found in the local data...
PUBMED RESEARCH RESULTS: PubMed search for 'strep throat' found...
WHO RESULTS: WHO Global Health Observatory data for 'strep throat'...
```

**AFTER**: The system now provides clean, unified answers like this:
```
Strep throat symptoms typically include a very sore throat, often accompanied by difficulty swallowing. You might also experience fever, headache, body aches, and sometimes a rash. It's important to see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment, as strep throat can lead to complications if left untreated.
```
